description: Summarise learnings from this session
---

You are extracting NEW knowledge from this session that would be valuable in future sessions.

## Process

1. **Check existing knowledge**:
   - Use project documentation already in your context (from @mentions/exploration)
   - Read previous learnings from `.tmp/memory-learnings.md` if it exists

2. **Identify NEW learnings** - Focus ONLY on:
   - User corrections ("No, actually it should be...")
   - New requirements not in existing documentation
   - Updated conventions or pattern changes
   - Fresh discoveries and solutions from this session
   - User workflow/style preferences

3. **Exclude**: Duplicates, general best practices, obvious codebase info

## Output Format

For each NEW learning:
- Use category prefix (e.g., "API Integration:", "Testing Strategy:")
- Be specific and actionable (include file paths/examples where relevant)
- Keep to 1-2 sentences
- Mark updates with "(Updated from previous session)"

Present findings showing:
1. What existing knowledge sources you checked
2. Only genuinely NEW learnings
3. Ask for validation: accuracy, missing info, session-specific exclusions

Then inform: "If you're happy with these NEW learnings, you can save them using `/learning-store`"

**Important**: Do NOT invoke `/learning-store` yourself. If no new learnings found, say so without suggesting storage.
