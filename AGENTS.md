# Instructions for Agents

## Project Goal

This project is a memory and learning system for AI coding agents.

The goal is to persist items of information which agents learn in a given session, and store them for future recall.

## Implementation

This memory system is implemented as a set of "commands" for opencode.

## Important files

The `README.md` file contains the project documentation.

The `command/` directory contains the command files, which make up the bulk of the project.

## External Documentation

The documentation for the opencode agent system can be found here: <https://opencode.ai/docs>
